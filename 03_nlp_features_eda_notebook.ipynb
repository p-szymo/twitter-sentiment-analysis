    "## Introduction\n",
    "[[go back to the top](##Masks-Throughout-COVID-19:-A-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)]\n",
    "\n",
    "After scraping Twitter with [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint), we will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets relating to masks and coronavirus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through text processing, exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, we will look for insights into how important words, topics, and subjectivity relate to sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then create predictive models that classify tweets as *negative*, *neutral*, or *positive*. This will help us provide further insight and confirm our findings during EDA. *(NOTE: To skip to the modeling notebook, click [here](04_modeling_notebook.ipynb))*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem domain\n",
    "[[go back to the top](##Masks-Throughout-COVID-19:-A-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation would like to use its current data to bolster or modify their environmental policy agenda while also looking for ways to improve their data collection for the next tree census in 2025. There is also some interest within the department to compare data collected by professional staff (members of the Parks Department and TreesCount) with that collected by volunteers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The department has tasked me with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify factors that contribute to the health status of a tree.\n",
    "- Create suggestions for improving future censuses.\n",
    "- Build a model that can predict a tree's health status, to verify the status determined by volunteers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required libraries\n",
    "[[go back to the top](##Masks-Throughout-COVID-19:-A-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)]\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses several Python packages that come standard with the Anaconda Python distribution. The primary libraries that we'll be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy**: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.\n",
    "- **pandas**: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.\n",
    "- **scikit-learn**: The essential Machine Learning package in Python.\n",
    "- **SciPy**: The essential statistical analysis package in Python.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Basic plotting library in Python; most other Python plotting libraries are built on top of it.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical plotting library.\n",
    "- **warnings**: A helpful package to ignore warnings that unnecessarily clutter the notebook.\n",
    "- **watermark**: A Jupyter Notebook extension for printing timestamps, version numbers, and hardware information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also uses some additional packages that you may have to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GeoPandas**: Provides a specialized GeoDataFrame structure to more easily analyze locational data.\n",
    "- **functions**: Custom functions that I built for this project (included by cloning this project's repo).\n",
